Version 1

About:
This is the starting point of a twitch chat bot I'm working on.

Installation:
Have node installed and run command prompt with node(or your prefered equivalent); change directory into twitchbot folder, and type 'node index.js'.  To quit, press ctrl + C.

Advanced:
There's like 3 working functions here because I couldn't figure out how to implement other stuff yet I don't think there's really anything advanced about this.

Known issues:
There aren't enough features!!
Can't upload entire node_modules folder to github.

Attributes:
Pretty much everything in here was from this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijl3GUHvKIw

Hopefully my next commit will have some features I wanted to implement into the bot.
